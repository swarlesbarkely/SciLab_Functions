# SciLab Functions
* angle (complex_var, ['deg' or 'rad'])

Returns the phase angle of a complex number between -180 and 180 (or -pi and pi). HINT: 'd' or 'r' can be used in place of 'deg' and 'rad', respectively

* choose (n, k)
 
Returns the number of combinations of k that can be made from n elements

* discreteplot (x-var, y-var)

Expansion on plot2d3 -- adds actual points to plot

* kdelta (n)

Kronecker Delta function -- returns a vector the size of n which is 1 when n = 0 and 0 otherwise

* pfe (expression)
 
Prints the partial fraction expansion of expression (always gives output in terms of x)

* trainglewave (t, frequency)
 
Returns a triangle wave signal the length of t which goes from -1 to 1 at the given frequency

* ustep (t)

Unit step function -- 1 for all t >= 0, 0 otherwise
